## Summary

**CatLingo** is an android app that clones the UI of DuoLingo.  

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ˜ºðŸ‘€ðŸ’¡**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [x] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [x] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [x] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [ ] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Used LinearLayout to add child views

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the **DuoLingo** app:
<table border="1">
 <tr>
  <th style='border:none;'>Original</th>
  <th style='border:none;'>Clone</th>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top" style='border:none;'><img src='https://github.com/gabrielaliera/Animal_App-CatLingo_UI_Answer_Page/blob/master/duoLingo_UI.png' title='Chosen Screenshot' width='200' heigth="400" alt='Chosen Screenshot' /></td>
   <td valign="top" style='border:none;'><img src='https://github.com/gabrielaliera/Animal_App-CatLingo_UI_Answer_Page/blob/master/catLingo_UI.PNG' title='CatLingo UI CLone' width='200' heigth="400" alt='CatLingo UI Clone' /></td>
   </tr>
  </table>

## Notes

Throughout the project, I utilized layout constraints and margins to emulate a comparable UI. Furthermore, I gained knowledge about Linear Layout, which enabled me to group similar views into a single container. Additionally, I acquired the ability to design a custom-shaped button using shape drawables. However, I encountered a problem where the custom button I had created was not being utilized by the Button view. To address this issue, I switched to android.widget.Button, allowing me to apply the custom button as a background and achieve the desired styling. I also upgraded the minSDK inorder to use tooltips.
